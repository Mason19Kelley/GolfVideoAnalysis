# Golf Video Analysis App

## Purpose

The purpose of this project to ultimately to learn some new technologies to expand my skillset while also having a practical application I can use for my golfing hobby. 
It will allow be to breakdown my swing using some cool video processing techniques to make more informed decisions about my swing.

## Features

1. Golf Swing Video Upload
2. Video analysis and processing(remains to be determined what video analysis features will be included)
3. User creation of lists containing stored video analyses
4. Ability to compare 2 different videos 
5. Hopefully, if the video analysis is robust enough, different charts showing different aspects of the swing such as timing or ball flight data.

## Tech Stack

1. Front-end
    - Vue(never used before)
2. Back-end
    - a Go back-end framework(still researching)
3. Database
    - Postgres(My main database of choice)
4. Video processing service
    - Probably will use python libraries, still deciding on how this will work.
